## Abstract: 
This project presents a full-stack fake news detection system using machine learning algorithms. The system collects news articles, extracts features, trains a machine learning model, and classifies news articles as fake or real. The proposed system utilizes natural language processing techniques and supervised learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in fake news detection. The system is deployed as a web application, providing a user-friendly interface for users to classify news articles.
